//  DESIGN:  I decided to save all settings in Application support over the UserDefaults
// 			 beause it seemed like Apple was moving away from that in favor of the app
//			 sandbox since there are new privacy requirements placed on saving to UserDefaults.
//  DESIGN:  Each of these two categories of setting are intentionally built to be very simple
//			 to extend, ideally without custom encoding.
//  DESIGN:  One approach below is the use of optionals for these properties so that the file
//			 is extensible without breaking in future additions.  Consider the upgrade path
// 			 at all times!
