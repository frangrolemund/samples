///  Controls and organizes the engine's interaction with the local network.

///  This firewall provides precise management over the external network ports
///  that are opened on the user's behalf. All actions will be explicitly authorized
///  and easily monitored by the hosting application to align its behavior to user
///  preferences.
///
///  The design of the engine networking requires that when it is initialized
///  or reloaded, the hosting app must affirm the configuration the firewall
///  interfaces used by the services.  Although some configuration may be saved
///  in the repo for this purpose, the final port assignment and enablement is not
///  and must be explicitly assigned in order for the network to come online.  The
///  ommission of explicit firewall configuration results in the equivlant of a
///  network segmentation where all engine behavior is inacessible outside the
///  hosting application.
