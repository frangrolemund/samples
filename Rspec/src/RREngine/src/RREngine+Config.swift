/*
 *  DESIGN:  The configuration is an authoritative reference of the data
 *  		 that defines the behavior of the engine that is created when the engine
 *   		 is first initialized and later represents any changes to that
 *   		 behavior during the course of operation.
 *  DESIGN:  This should be considered a _cache_ of what was on disk +- any changes
 *           made to the current running engine behavior.
 *  DESIGN:  Runtime state of the engine is never saved in this structure because it
 *  		 is the basis for a document-based system for interacting with the engine.
 *  DESIGN:  The configuration deals primarily in NODEs as you can see below, which is
 *  		 intentional because a node is a special type of dynamo that naturally supports
 *  		 full encoding and naturally translates into the stateful runtime with complimentary
 * 			 references.
