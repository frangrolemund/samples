 *  Stateful processors are entities that acquire non-trivial state
 *  during the course of directed or autonomous processing and often
 *  require methodical shutdown.
 *  DESIGN:  Shutdown *must* work the first time it is tried or die hard
 * 			 trying. There is no failure path to recover or retry because
 *  		 it is permitted to occur during object deinit when there is
 *  		 only a single opportunity.
