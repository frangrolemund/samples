## Objective - 'Contact Sheet'
Behavior: web contact form to sign up for comms.

General-purpose code for a traditional multi-platform solution with:
- database
- server w/APIs	
- web app that maintains the data

Implement this in source file to distill the smallest possible thing.
....
Notes:
- still too verbose - it looks just like any other language
- structures and hierarchical concepts are interesting.
