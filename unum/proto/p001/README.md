## Objective - 'Contact Sheet'
Behavior: web contact form to sign up for comms.

General-purpose code for a traditional multi-platform solution with:
- database
- server w/APIs	
- web app that maintains the data

Implement this in source file to distill the smallest possible thing.
....
Notes:
- incomplete
- some interesting ideas, exploring errors of linkage.
- need to probably think hard about class vs. struct
- UI needs some non-trivial amount of control over it - it isn't realistic
to completely exclude basic layout.  even the most inexperienced people still
don't want their work to look like crap
