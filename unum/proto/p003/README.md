## Objective - 'Contact Sheet'
Behavior: web contact form to sign up for comms.

General-purpose code for a traditional multi-platform solution with:
- database
- server w/APIs	
- web app that maintains the data

Implement this in source file to distill the smallest possible thing.
....
Notes:
- much simpler when persistence is derived by the compiler
- some minor changes to syntax can shorten the required behavior
- safe concurrency by assuming the rule of 'one' - develop as if there is only
one instance running.
