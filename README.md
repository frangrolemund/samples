# Projects

## [ChatSeal](./ChatSeal)
**Language**: `Objective-C`

App for delivering secure chat over Twitter using steganography, built in the 
iOS4-7 timeframe.  It was published and in the App Store for a brief period and
worked successfully with Twitter feeds as a transport protocol, which was a
pretty cool to see work.


## [MetStudy](./metstudy)
**Language**: Swift/SwiftUI

Mobile app concept to experiment with SwiftUI mobile design patterns using a 
public data set.  The idea is for it to be a combination of a macOS 'designer'
to curate MetArt content and an mobile 'player' to consume it.


## The Distributed Problem
These are a couple evolutions of work I've done to explore ways to address some
of the costs of distributed software.

### [Rspec](./Rspec)
**Language**: Swift/SwiftUI

A macOS concept to diagram distributed systems with the ease of using a 
spreadsheet, while allowing them to be redeployed later.  

### [unum](./unum)
**Language**: `n/a`

Some conceptual work (code not included) for a more recent project to build a
platform for 'systemic programming' which aims to eliminate the costs of linkage
in distributed service architectures.
