# Projects

## [ChatSeal](./ChatSeal)
**Language**: `Objective-C`
App for delivering secure chat over Twitter using steganography, built in the 
iOS4-7 timeframe.  It was published and in the App Store for a brief period and
worked successfully with Twitter feeds as a transport protocol, which was a
pretty cool to see work.


## The Distributed Problem
These are a couple evolutions of work I've done to explore ways to address some
of the costs of distributed software.

### [Rspec](./Rspec)
**Language**: Swift/SwiftUI
The idea here was to be able to diagram a distributed system with the ease of
using a spreadsheet, while allowing it to be redeployed later.  

### [unum](./unum)
**Language**: `n/a`
Some conceptual work (code not included) for a more recent project to build a
platform for 'systemic programming' which aims to eliminate the costs of linkage
in distributed service architectures.
