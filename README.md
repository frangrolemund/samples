# Overview
This repo contains a collection of coding and project samples I've worked on 
over the years and continue to pursue independently when time permits.  These
are provided as examples of the types of things I work on, but aren't intended
to necessarily be valuable to anyone.  In some cases, the code no longer builds
with latest tools. 

Everything here is of my own invention and independent work.  References to
'RealProven, LLC' are to my own company.

The code and ideas are under copyright by me and _only_ provided for 
informational purposes.  No license is provided or implied by their publication.
