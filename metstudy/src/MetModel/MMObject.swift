/*
 *  An 'object' is the terminology of the MetArt REST API that
 *  represents a single exhibit in their collection.
 *  
 *  I'm using this terminology internally to ensure consistency
 *  with the back-end explanations.  It will precisely match the
 *  definitions at https://metmuseum.github.io/#object.
 *
 *  DESIGN: This clearly looks very similar to the MMExhibitRef with
 * 	 		good reason because they both represent the same data, but
 * 			since the content is slightly different between the two I
 * 			think it is important to differentiate them here.  The
 * 			reference is an indicator of the content, but this is the
 * 			'official' record.
 *
 *  DESIGN: These are built to be constant and fairly exact to the back-end
 *  		to reflect the origin of the information.
