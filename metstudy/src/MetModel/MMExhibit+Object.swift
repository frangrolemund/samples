 *  Accessors for the internal object data.
 *  DESIGN: This intends is to keep the internal type as exactly identical to the back-end
 * 			definition as possible, while insulating the callers from those constraints.
 *  DESIGN: I'm using computed properties instead of embedded ones here because most of
 *  		this instance is rarely displayed in a UI so I figured that it is better to
 *  		compute-on-demand for the less often used elements as a rule.
