MetDesigner v1.0
Design Document
------------------

Objective:  
	To use the MetObjects dataset to produce a single optimized tour
        definition that can be used by a 'player' app.

Problems:
	- MetObjects is a huge file
	- MetObjects is incomplete wrt the online API content

Overall:
	A document-based macOS app that requires importing a MetObjects file
	before the tours can be defined.  

	A master-detail organization with the master acting as some sort
	of navigator for the tours and plans (combinations of tours) and the 
	detail operating as a design editor for a single tour.

	A tour is a self-contained sequence of exhibits that can be played
	much like a movie.  It an optimized list of small resources for 
	previous purposes with the expectation that additional data can be
	downloaded at runtime, but is not strictly required.

	Eventually, tours can be multi-selected and built into a tour plan.

Vocabulary:
	object:		A single entity from the MetObjects index that has
			not been queried from the web.
	exhibit: 	A single entity from the Met Art index + web source
	tour: 		A curated sequence of Met Art exhibits with associated 
			resources and commentary that can be used to 
			delightfully experience the history of those items.
	plan:		A curated group of one or more tours.

Ideas:
	- The Navigator shows a list of tours with an addition button next to
	them and a 'Default' tour when the document is created.  It will show
	exhibits under the tour in a list.  The tour can be selected or the
	exhibits selected, but one of the two is always selected.  Selecting
	an exhibit implies the tour.

	- Selecting the row in the master/navigator changes the detail

	- The detail is composed of two columns: editor and property inspector

	- The editor is a column that has the index at the top always with 
	a search bar for finding things.  The user can select items in the 
	index and drop them into the tour.  When the document is first created
	the index is empty and has a button to load the index objects.  Below
	the index is the tour editor which shows a sequence of exhibits.

	- The index displays the objects, but by selecting one it displays
	the properties of the baseline exhibit in the property inspector.  The
	user can drag an item from the index into the navigator or into the
	tour.

	- When a tour is created, it can be exported by right-clicking on it.
